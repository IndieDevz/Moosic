**Why do we store this information?**

1. Discord

Discord data is stored to make sure Moosic can operate, provide "premium" perks to certain users and allow servers to set their own settings.
2. Patreon (this only applies if you are actively subscribed to one of our patreon plans)

Patreon data is stored to make sure we can connect your Patreon pledge tier to Discord and give you the perks you bought to the right accounts and servers.

3. Opt-in

• Any per-server settings you might have changed

These are only saved if you change the default settings of Moosic in your server and are needed to make sure the settings you set persist over your period of time using chip within your server.

• The entirety of the queue in any server

As soon as you play a song with Moosic we store a copy of your queue, this is to make sure that if Moosic has an outage, we can resume the song you were playing once Moosic has recovered. It does not matter if you have one or 800 songs queued, all songs will be saved.

**Data deletion**
